Compiler Construction Project E Code generation for a lazy functional language

Ferdinand van Walree 3874389 and Matthew Swart 5597250

This project uses the following compiler verions:
- Haskell version: 7.10.2-a
- uuagc-0.9.52.1
- uhc-light
To build the package it is necessary to execute the following instructions:
- Type in the console: "make". 
- Goto the "src" folder and type in the console "./build.sh"

Our language the following cases:
Nat
Var
Nil -> Not really sure. I think this function could be deleted.
Cons -> Not really sure?
Prim -> to accept features of the corerun compiler.
App
Let

It also possible to use a list. We did this by adding it manually in the Hm2Cr.ag. These functions will always be included in the outputfile, so that they can be used by the uses defined function. The following features are possible on a list.
-   isNil
-   isCons
-   tail
-   head
-   cons
-   nil


Design
ParseHM.hs -> added after parsing, the toANormal, to change the structure of the program, to make it easier for us to get the relevance information from the datatype.

Core.ag -> This is the standard form
HM.ag -> These are used to
