Compiler Construction Project t-digram

To use our project, we recommend to use the following tools:
- Haskell version: 7.10.2-a
- Winrar/7zip/tar
To build the package it is necessary to execute the following instructions:
- Unpack Assignment1-0.1.0.0.tar.gz
- Go to the directory Assignment1-0.1.0.0 
- Type in the console: "cabal install"
Now cabal installs everything needed to execute our code. 
In the cabal package we included all the files.
To use these package you need to be in the root of the folder Assignment1-0.1.0.0. 
In this folder you can import the packages. Outside this directory it is not possible to use them, because we use a sandbox.
The other theoretical assigments are included as extra-source-files.
